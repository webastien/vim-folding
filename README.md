# vim-folding
A simple plugin to manage folding

## About
This plugin is far to be perfect and only takes care of PHP files (works with any other filetypes but even simpler). I was using [PIV](https://github.com/spf13/PIV) but on big files, it was soooooo slow! I've quickly write this one as an emergency replacement and finaly keep it because it's light and enought for my actual needs.
